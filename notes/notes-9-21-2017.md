### Game Scheduling

- Grace period after end of round to sync distance
- Client can send alerts about round ending soon
- One GMT time zone (at midnight) for everyone, generated on the device
and sent to server. Server stuff will be in GMT, based on local time zone
of the user. This will prevent us from having to process all round endings
at once

### Qualifying Round

- On game create, queue Job that will execute when round is over
  - Job will update game and select zombie based on lottery system
  - Start with one zombie, make extensible for more
- API should accept game create time in GMT
- New columns on Game and Player for stats
  - Player has distance
  - Schema validations

### Scheduler

- Should be able to introspect Jobs (e.g. fields like `status`)
- Strategies for failed Jobs
- JobDefinition strategies
- Tests

### Other

- What happens if a zombie is a piece of shit and does nothing? (ELMO)
- TestFlight is $99 for a year, let's do it soon
