### Integration

- [kz] slow movement, but have all friend request stuff working
- individually requesting and declining friend requests
- iOS issue, requests take a while and have lag time
- seed runner had the invalid username issues (fixed by [ms])
  - [ms] instructions in top level of #general
- **Ready to move forward**. [kz] is going home this week and will catch up
with backend after getting back

### Game Start

**Time Zones**
- Game start time selected when Game is created
- time zone based on User that starts the game
- server stores time in UTC

**Game Start Time**
- Start date is picked from limited selections (today, tomorrow, day after)
- **Not doing this feature since Qualifier Round takes care of it**

**Qualifier round**
- game `status` is `qualifying` (no more need for `pending`)
- invite anyone
- nobody is a zombie, someone from lower step count group becomes zombie
  - TODO decision making process for zombie choice
- have some time to add more people
- [ms] what does it mean to qualify? An owner could get him/herself ahead by
inviting people at the last minute during the qualifier round
  - [ci] take away incentive
  - [kz] the more you walk, the lower your chance of getting selected, but
  everyone has a chance
    - **we're doing this**
  - [ms] count distance from the time of when the last user joined
- this round has separate handling, other rounds will be more consistent
- countdown for _suspense_ at end of round

### Other

- MVP
  - [ci] registration email, make sure people are real users
  - [kz] some way to identify that a request is coming directly from the
  client app, to avoid MITM attacks, unauthorized requests, etc.

- Apple Health
  - [kz] Let's trust it to sync if someone gets a new phone
