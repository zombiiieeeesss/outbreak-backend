**Search**
- [kz] have search `users`, search `friends`
- [ms] Cam did User search, I did create friend request and listing
of friends (in PR)
  - [kz] good to have a list of friends to tap and add to game
  - [ms] do we need friend search?
    - [kz] we can do local search
  - [ms] Example response from friends list
  ```json
  {
    "friend": {
      "email": "email-24@example.com",
      "id": 2556,
      "username": "email-24@example.com"
    },
   "id": 692,
   "requesting_user_id": 2555,
   "status": "pending"
  }
  ```
- [ci] search is by query param, `username` or `email`
- [kz] one query to search both
- We're indexing `username` and `email`
- All users that match the "leviathan" of either `username` or `email`
- [ms] We should be able to update the ecto query
  ```elixir
  DB.Repo.all(
    from u in User,
    where: fragment(
      "levenshtein(lower(?), lower(?))", u.username or u.email, ^query_string
    ) < @levenshtein,
    order_by: fragment("levenshtein(lower(?), lower(?))", u.username, ^query_string),
    limit: 10
  )
  ```
  - [ms] the tests passed so it's definitely good
  - [ci] we'll update the query param
  - [ms] conventional query param is `?q=`
  - [ms] this is a slow query because of the `order_by` and `where`

**Next feature**
  - [ci] still need to add accept/reject, then invite to games
  - [ci] nothing else to add, besides we still need to do integration stuff
  > "Inviting is a whole different beast" - Michael Smykowski

**Documentation**
  - [kz] Plan: get VC funding, get a FB search engineer
  - [kz, ms] we don't know Markdown
    - [ci] my company writes docs with it
    - [ms] Confluence sucks
    
**Plan**
  - Cam will update the search
  - Kris will integrate with staging env
  - Cam & Mike will merge PRs
