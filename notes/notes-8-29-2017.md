### Integration

- UI elements working, updating/deleting still TODO
  - update/delete is quick
  - demo!

### Inviting Users to Games

- Required for MVP
  - Game owner invites Users to Games
    - New ticket for allowing users to own games
    - Create a Player (bulk)
    - Update Player status if accept
    - Delete Player if reject
    - Bulk update?
    - List invites (players where player id matches, preload Game)
      - For Games endpoint, look at associated player, include
      player id and player status in response
  - Schemas
    - New `Player` model
    - Just have `Player` with status
      - `user_pending`, `active`
- Nice to have
  - Request to join
    - `owner_pending` concept
  - Suggest someone to invite
  - Games can be public
- Future considerations
  - Might need to break out the Invite process into
  dedicated schemas, requiring migration

### Design

- How do we display data?
  - We need user testing
- Do we want to be able to search for users by friends only?
